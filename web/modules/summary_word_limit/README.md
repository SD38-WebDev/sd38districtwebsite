# Summary Word Limit

This simple module allows you to add a word count limit to the summary of `text_with_summary` - **AKA Text (formatted, long, with summary)** - field types.

This is enabled via third party settings on the field config, and implemented using a validation constraint.

To set a word count limit for the summary, edit a Text with summary field and enter a number in the 'Summary word limit count' field. Be sure to check the 'Summary input' box if necessary.
